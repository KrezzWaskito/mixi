Mixi is a 3x3 (9 keys) layout macropad with rotary encoder support and yes... RGB
underglow! This is my first project that could run into a GB (at Indonesian Mech
Keyboard group) with a total of 50 participants + others who could not join
because of the limit. The purpose of this project is to provide the user a
simple yet powerful macropad with a low-level price. And also to encourage me
to do another projects.
